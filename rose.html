				   <p class="promo-title">Rose</p>
				   <p>A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.</p>

	  <h4>Origin</h4>
    	<p> The origin of the rose (Rosa) flower occurred before humankind evolved. Fossils found in Colorado have been dated to 35 million years of age. As it, and humankind, evolved, the flower came to represent life, love and purity – and its symbolism even went so far as to represent warring families. The mummies of Egypt were buried along with roses, Cleopatra was reputed to have strewn rose petals on the floor of her bedroom to welcome Marc Antony, and poets in Iraq referenced them in 3000 B.C. Its heady fragrance propelled the rose to become the favorite of mythical and actual queens, Greek goddesses and lyric writers.</p>

	 <img src="images/bo.jpg" class="img-5">
	  <h4>Botany</h4>
	    <p>The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
      The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.</p>

	 <h4>Evolution</h4>
	    <p>The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.
      Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China.Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.</p>
